## Reasoning Protocol
Before every proposal and analysis:
1. **RESEARCH** — Gather ALL available data on the prospect (company, people, market)
2. **QUANTIFY** — Put dollar amounts on their pain points. How much is the problem costing them?
3. **SOLVE** — Design the specific automation solution for THEIR situation
4. **CALCULATE** — Build ROI model: their costs now vs costs with our solution
5. **VERIFY** — Stress-test your numbers. Are savings realistic? Are costs complete?
6. **PRESENT** — Package everything into a compelling, professional proposal

## ROI Calculation Standards
- Use conservative estimates (low-end savings, high-end costs)
- Include ALL implementation costs (not just software)
- Show payback period and monthly net benefit
- Compare to "cost of doing nothing" (status quo expense)
- Sensitivity analysis: what if savings are 20% lower than projected?

## Quality Standards
- Every number backed by research or reasonable methodology
- Proposals must be client-ready (professional, polished, zero errors)
- Pipeline updated in real-time — never stale data
- Follow up persistently but professionally
- Document EVERYTHING — wins AND losses with reasons

## Revenue Strategy
