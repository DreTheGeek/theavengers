## BUSINESS EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

### The 5-Filter Test (Every Opportunity Must Pass):
1. **Market Size**: TAM > $1B or niche with >$100M addressable. Too small = not worth the effort.
2. **Margin Potential**: Can we achieve 40%+ gross margin? Below that, scaling is painful.
3. **Automatable**: Can 80%+ of the business run on AI/automation? That's Kaldr Tech's edge.
4. **Speed to Revenue**: Can we generate revenue in <90 days? No multi-year development cycles.
5. **Defensibility**: What's the moat? Brand, data, network effects, switching costs, or proprietary tech.

### Financial Modeling Template:
```
REVENUE MODEL:
Units/customers × Price × Frequency = Monthly Revenue
Monthly Revenue × 12 = Annual Revenue

COST STRUCTURE:
Fixed costs: Hosting, software, salaries, insurance
Variable costs: COGS, transaction fees, support, marketing
Total Monthly Costs = Fixed + (Variable × Units)

UNIT ECONOMICS:
CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) = Marketing spend ÷ New customers
LTV (Lifetime Value) = Avg revenue per customer × Avg retention months × Gross margin
LTV:CAC Ratio Target: >3:1 (good), >5:1 (excellent)

PROFITABILITY:
Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
Net Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
Gross Margin = Gross Profit ÷ Revenue
Net Margin = Net Profit ÷ Revenue

BREAK-EVEN:
Break-even Units = Fixed Costs ÷ (Price - Variable Cost per Unit)
Break-even Revenue = Fixed Costs ÷ Gross Margin %
```

### Scenario Planning:
Always model 3 scenarios:
- **Best Case** (20% probability): Everything goes right. Viral growth, high conversion, low churn.
- **Expected Case** (60% probability): Realistic based on industry benchmarks.
- **Worst Case** (20% probability): What if growth is 50% slower and costs are 30% higher?
- **Key question**: Is the business viable even in the worst case?

## BUSINESS MODEL TYPES

### SaaS (Software as a Service):
- **Revenue**: Monthly/annual subscriptions
- **Margins**: 70-90% gross margin (best in class)
- **Metrics**: MRR, ARR, churn rate, LTV, CAC
- **Benchmark churn**: <5%/month (SMB), <2%/month (mid-market), <1%/month (enterprise)
- **Best for**: Recurring revenue, predictable growth, high valuation multiples (5-15x ARR)

### Agency/Service:
- **Revenue**: Project fees + retainers
- **Margins**: 40-60% gross margin
- **Metrics**: Revenue per employee, utilization rate, client retention
- **Scaling challenge**: Revenue tied to headcount (unless you automate)
- **Best for**: Quick revenue, proven demand, but hard to scale past $1-5M without systems

### Marketplace:
- **Revenue**: Transaction fees (10-30% take rate)
- **Margins**: 60-80% (once established)
- **Challenge**: Chicken-and-egg problem (need buyers AND sellers)
- **Best for**: High volume, network effects, winner-take-most dynamics

### E-Commerce/DTC:
- **Revenue**: Product sales
- **Margins**: 30-50% gross (physical), 60-80% (digital)
- **Metrics**: AOV, conversion rate, ROAS, repeat purchase rate
- **Best for**: Fast to launch, proven with Deondre's operation

### White Label:
- **Revenue**: Reselling another company's product under your brand
- **Margins**: 30-60% depending on provider
- **Key benefit**: No product development needed. Speed to market.
- **Best for**: Proven products where brand/distribution is the value-add

## INDUSTRY ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### Porter's Five Forces (Quick Assessment):
1. **Competitive Rivalry**: How many competitors? How differentiated? (High rivalry = compressed margins)
2. **Threat of New Entrants**: How easy to start? Capital requirements? Regulatory barriers?
3. **Threat of Substitutes**: Can the problem be solved a completely different way?
4. **Buyer Power**: How many buyers? Can they easily switch? Price sensitivity?
5. **Supplier Power**: How many suppliers? Can they raise prices? Switching costs?

### Market Timing Signals:
- **Rising Google Trends** for problem/solution keywords = growing demand
- **Venture capital flowing** into the space = smart money sees opportunity
- **Incumbent companies struggling** = disruption opportunity
- **New regulation** = compliance opportunity
- **Technology breakthrough** = new business models possible

## PRESENTATION SCORING RUBRIC

### Confidence Score (1-10):
- **9-10**: Data-backed, proven demand, clear path to profit. Strong GO.
- **7-8**: Good data, reasonable assumptions, some uncertainty. Likely GO.
- **5-6**: Mixed signals. Needs more research or a small test before committing.
- **3-4**: Weak data, high uncertainty, significant risks. Likely NO-GO.
- **1-2**: Bad economics, saturated market, or fundamental flaw. Hard NO.

### GO/NO-GO Decision Criteria:
**GO** requires ALL of:
- Expected ROI > 100% within 12 months
- Break-even within 6 months
- Startup cost within LaSean's approved budget
- Clear automation path (Kaldr Tech's edge)
- At least 2 of 3 scenarios are profitable

**NO-GO** if ANY of:
- LTV:CAC ratio < 2:1
- Market is declining (Google Trends down)
- No clear differentiation from 5+ existing competitors
- Requires skills/resources Kaldr Tech doesn't have
- Regulatory risk is high and unclear
