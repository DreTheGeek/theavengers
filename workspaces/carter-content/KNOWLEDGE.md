# Carter's Content Knowledge Base

## PLATFORM ALGORITHMS (2026)

### Instagram Algorithm:
- **Primary metric**: Views (replaced Likes as the #1 metric in 2025)
- **Key signals** (in order of weight):
  1. **Saves** — Highest weight. Content worth saving = content worth showing.
  2. **Shares** (DMs + Stories reshares) — Algorithmic rocket fuel.
  3. **Comments** (especially replies/threads) — Depth of engagement matters.
  4. **Watch time** (Reels) — Completion rate + replays = viral signal.
  5. **Profile visits** after viewing — Shows genuine interest.
- **Engagement rate benchmark**: 0.48% average. Above 1% = excellent. Above 3% = viral territory.
- **Best formats**: Reels (80% of reach), Carousels (highest Saves), Stories (profile boost)
- **Optimal posting times**: 7-9 AM, 12-1 PM, 7-9 PM ET
- **Hashtag strategy**: 3-5 targeted hashtags. Mix of small (10K-100K), medium (100K-1M), niche-specific.

### TikTok Algorithm:
- **Primary metric**: Watch time completion rate (% who watch the entire video)
- **Key signals**:
  1. **Watch completion** — The ONLY metric that truly matters. 100% watch = pushed to more people.
  2. **Replays** — Count as double watch time. Short + rewatchable = viral.
  3. **Shares** — Send to friend = highest engagement signal.
  4. **Comments** — Controversial or question-prompting content wins.
  5. **Follows from video** — Shows content is discoverable.
- **Engagement rate benchmark**: 3.70% average (highest of any platform, up 49% YoY).
- **Best video length**: 7-15 seconds (highest completion), 30-60 seconds (most shares).
- **For You Page mechanics**: New content gets shown to a small test audience (~300-500 views). If engagement is high, it gets pushed to a larger audience. This repeats in waves.
- **Optimal posting**: 7-9 AM, 12-3 PM, 7-11 PM ET. Consistency > timing.
- **Original sounds**: Get preferential distribution over reused sounds.

### LinkedIn Algorithm:
- **Primary metric**: Dwell Time (how long someone spends reading/viewing your post)
- **Key signals**:
  1. **Dwell Time** — Long posts that people actually READ get pushed.
  2. **"See more" clicks** — Signals interesting content. Write a killer first 3 lines.
  3. **Saves** — Growing in importance.
  4. **Meaningful Comments** — Long, thoughtful comments >> "Great post!"
  5. **Shares to feed** — Amplification signal.
- **Best formats**: Long text posts (1,000-1,500 chars), Document/carousel posts, Polls
- **Best days**: Tuesday-Thursday. Drop off on weekends.
- **Optimal posting**: 7-8 AM, 12 PM, 5-6 PM ET
- **Algorithm tip**: Post, then reply to every comment within 1 hour. This extends the post's lifecycle.

### X/Twitter Algorithm:
- **Primary metric**: Replies (conversations > broadcasts)
- **Key signals**:
  1. **Replies** — Sparking conversation is the #1 signal.
  2. **Bookmarks** — Private saves = high-value content signal.
  3. **Retweets/Reposts** — Amplification.
  4. **Quote tweets** — Shows content worth discussing.
  5. **Time spent on tweet** — Longer tweets (200-280 chars) outperform short ones.
- **Best formats**: Threads (5-10 tweets), long tweets with hooks, image tweets
- **Optimal posting**: 8-10 AM, 12-1 PM ET

### Facebook Algorithm:
- **Primary metric**: Meaningful interactions (shares, comments, reactions)
- **Key signals**: Shares to Messenger > Comments > Reactions > Clicks
- **Best formats**: Video (native, not YouTube links), link posts with compelling preview
- **Optimal posting**: 9-11 AM, 1-3 PM ET

### Threads Algorithm:
- **Primary metric**: Replies and Reposts
- **Best for**: Conversational, community-building content. Less polished than Instagram.
- **Growing fast**: New API features make this a strong emerging platform.

Every post must deliver at least ONE:
- **V**isual appeal — Beautiful, eye-catching, scroll-stopping
- **A**ction — Teaches them something they can DO right now

### Content Pillars for Kaldr Tech:
1. **Education** (40%): How AI automation works, industry insights, tips
2. **Social Proof** (25%): Case studies, results, testimonials, behind-the-scenes
3. **Personality** (20%): Day-in-the-life, hot takes, team culture, humor
4. **Promotion** (15%): Product launches, offers, CTAs, demos

### Content Repurposing Chain:
```
1 Long Video → TikTok clip → Instagram Reel → YouTube Short
                → LinkedIn text post (key insights)
                → X/Twitter thread (key points)
                → Facebook post (with native video)
                → Instagram carousel (key frames)
                → Threads post (conversational take)
= 1 piece of content → 8 platform-specific posts
```

## AI IMAGE PROMPT ENGINEERING

### Replicate Flux Pro — Best Practices:
- Be specific: "Professional photo of [subject], [setting], [lighting], [style]"
- Specify aspect ratio: "9:16 portrait" for Reels/TikTok, "1:1 square" for feed
- Include lighting: "soft natural light", "golden hour", "studio lighting", "neon lit"
- Include style: "photorealistic", "minimalist", "editorial", "cinematic"
- For text in images: Use OpenAI GPT Image 1 instead — it renders text better

### Prompt Template:
```
[Style] photo of [subject] [doing action], [setting/background],
[lighting], [camera angle], [mood/atmosphere], [aspect ratio]
```

### Example Prompts:
- Product showcase: "Professional product photography of [product] on minimalist white surface, soft studio lighting, overhead angle, clean modern aesthetic, 1:1 square"
- Lifestyle: "Candid photo of happy HVAC technician using tablet in modern home, natural window light, warm tones, photorealistic, 9:16 portrait"
- Quote graphic: Use OpenAI → "Modern minimalist quote card with text '[quote]' in bold sans-serif font, dark gradient background, 1:1 square"

## HASHTAG STRATEGY

### The 3-5-3 Rule:
- 3 broad hashtags (100K-1M posts): Reach new audiences
- 5 niche hashtags (10K-100K posts): Target your exact audience
- 3 branded/specific hashtags (<10K): Own your space

### By Platform:
- **Instagram**: 5-10 hashtags. Put in caption, not comments.
- **TikTok**: 3-5 hashtags. Include 1 trending + 2 niche.
- **LinkedIn**: 3-5 hashtags. Mix industry + topic.
- **X**: 1-2 hashtags max. Overusing looks spammy.
- **Facebook**: 0-2 hashtags. They barely matter here.
- **Threads**: 0-1 hashtag. Conversational platform.

## VIRAL CONTENT PATTERNS

### What Makes Content Go Viral:
1. **Emotional arousal**: Content that triggers strong emotion (surprise, awe, anger, joy) gets shared 3x more than neutral content.
2. **Social currency**: People share things that make THEM look good (smart, funny, informed).
3. **Practical value**: "I need to save this" = Saves + Shares.
4. **Storytelling**: Narrative arc (problem → struggle → resolution) outperforms facts.
5. **Timing**: Riding a trend within 24 hours of it emerging = 10x the reach.
6. **Relatability**: "This is SO me" = comments + shares to friends.

### Content Types by Virality Potential:
| Type | Viral Potential | Best Platform |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| Transformation/before-after | Very High | TikTok, Instagram |
| Controversial take | High | X, LinkedIn, TikTok |
| Tutorial/how-to | Medium-High | All platforms |
| Behind-the-scenes | Medium | Instagram, TikTok |
| Data/statistics | Medium | LinkedIn, X |
| Meme/humor | High (but short lifespan) | All platforms |
| User-generated content | Very High | Instagram, TikTok |
