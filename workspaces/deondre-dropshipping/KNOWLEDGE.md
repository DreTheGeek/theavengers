# Deondre's Dropshipping Knowledge Base

## PRODUCT SOURCING PLATFORMS

### AliExpress:
- **Best for**: Testing products cheaply, wide selection, no MOQ
- **Shipping**: ePacket 7-15 days, AliExpress Standard 15-30 days
- **Tips**: Filter by 4.5+ stars, 1000+ orders, ePacket available
- **Risks**: Inconsistent quality, slow shipping, no branding options
- **Use case**: Initial product testing before moving to better supplier

### CJ Dropshipping:
- **Best for**: Faster shipping (US warehouse 3-8 days), custom packaging, print-on-demand
- **Shipping**: US warehouse = 3-8 days, China = 8-15 days
- **Tips**: Use their sourcing request feature — they find products for you
- **Risks**: Higher product cost than AliExpress (but better overall)
- **Use case**: Scaling winners — move from AliExpress to CJ for speed

### Spocket:
- **Best for**: US/EU suppliers, fastest shipping (2-5 days), higher quality
- **Shipping**: US/EU = 2-5 days
- **Tips**: Filter by US suppliers for fastest delivery
- **Risks**: Highest product costs, limited catalog vs AliExpress
- **Use case**: Premium products where fast shipping justifies higher price

### Supplier Evaluation Criteria:
| Factor | Weight | How to Check |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Product quality | 30% | Order sample, check reviews, defect reports |
| Shipping speed | 25% | Test orders, track times over 10+ shipments |
| Communication | 15% | Response time, English quality, problem resolution |
| Price consistency | 15% | Check for sudden price increases, MOQ changes |
| Packaging quality | 15% | Does it arrive undamaged? Branding options? |

## PRICING & MARGIN FRAMEWORK

### The Formula:
```
Selling Price = Product Cost × 3 (minimum)
Target margin: 40-60% after ALL costs

Full Cost Breakdown:
Product cost: $X (from supplier)
Shipping: $X (supplier shipping rate)
Platform fees: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (Shopify Payments)
Shopify plan: $39/month ÷ orders = $X per order
Ad cost per unit: Total ad spend ÷ orders = $X (target: < 30% of selling price)
Returns/refunds: ~3-5% of revenue (budget for it)
```

### Pricing Tiers by Selling Price:
- **$10-20**: Impulse buys. Need high volume. Margin tight after ads. Best for viral products.
- **$20-40**: Sweet spot. Good margin, low enough for impulse. Most winning products live here.
- **$40-70**: Higher margin, lower volume. Need stronger ad creative and social proof.
- **$70-150**: High-ticket dropshipping. Needs video ads, reviews, trust signals. Highest profit per sale.
- **$150+**: Difficult to dropship. Customers expect premium experience. Only with established brand.

### Price Anchoring:
- Show "Compare at" price 2-3x your selling price
- Bundle products to increase AOV: "Buy 2 Save 15%"
- Free shipping threshold above your avg order value (if AOV is $25, free shipping at $35)
- Tiered discounts: "Buy 1: $29.99 | Buy 2: $24.99 each | Buy 3: $19.99 each"

## PRODUCT RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

### Step 1: Discovery (Find Candidates)
Search these daily:
- TikTok: #tiktokmademebuyit, #amazonfinds, #droshippping, #productreview
- Google Trends: Rising searches in "Shopping" category
- Amazon: Movers & Shakers, Best Sellers (new entries)
- Competitor stores: Scrape /products.json, check "New Arrivals"
- AliExpress: Hot Products, Top Selling

### Step 2: Validation (Apply Winner Criteria)
Every product must pass ALL 7:
1. ✅ **Margin ≥ 40%** after ALL costs including estimated ad spend
2. ✅ **Wow Factor** — scrolling thumb stops. "That's cool" reaction.
3. ✅ **Problem Solver OR Impulse Buy** — either fixes a pain or triggers desire
4. ✅ **Not Locally Available** — can't buy at Walmart/Target easily
5. ✅ **Lightweight & Small** — cheap to ship, fewer damages in transit
6. ✅ **No Legal Risks** — no patents, no trademarks, no regulatory issues
7. ✅ **Proven Demand** — social proof exists (TikTok views, reviews, Google Trends rising)

### Step 3: Competitive Analysis
- How many other stores sell this? (Search Google Shopping, Facebook Ad Library)
- Can you differentiate? (Better price, bundle, better photos, faster shipping)
- How long have competitors been running ads? (If 6+ months = proven demand)
- If market is saturated (20+ stores, same ad creative) = PASS

### Step 4: Testing
- Create product page with 5+ images, compelling description, social proof
- Launch $20-50/day ad spend (Facebook/TikTok)
- Test 3 different ad creatives
- Run for 3 days minimum
- Kill if: <1% conversion rate, CPA > 50% of selling price
- Scale if: >2% conversion, profitable ROAS, positive customer feedback

## AD CREATIVE BEST PRACTICES

### Video Ads (Best Performing):
- Hook in first 1 second (problem statement or "Wait for it..." visual)
- Show the product solving a problem in seconds 2-5
- Social proof (reviews, "over 10,000 sold") in seconds 5-10
- Call to action ("Shop now — link in bio / 50% off today only")
- Total length: 15-30 seconds (TikTok), 15-60 seconds (Facebook)

### Image Ads:
- Lifestyle images > product-on-white-background
- Before/after if applicable
- Show the product in use, not just sitting there
- Include a text overlay with the key benefit
- Use high contrast colors that pop on mobile

### Ad Copy Framework:
```
HOOK: [Attention-grabbing problem or benefit statement]
BODY: [How the product solves the problem + key features]
PROOF: [Reviews, "10,000+ happy customers", statistics]
CTA: [Urgency + action — "Shop now — 50% off ends tonight"]
```

## SHOPIFY STORE OPTIMIZATION

### Product Page Must-Haves:
1. 5+ high-quality images (lifestyle + detail + infographic)
2. Compelling title with benefit (not just product name)
3. Price with "Compare at" anchor
4. Bullet points with benefits (not features)
5. Customer reviews (import or collect real ones)
6. Trust badges (secure checkout, money-back guarantee, fast shipping)
7. FAQ section addressing top 3 objections
8. Urgency elements (low stock, timer — use sparingly and honestly)

### Conversion Rate Benchmarks:
- Below 1%: Something is broken (price, traffic quality, page design)
- 1-2%: Below average. Optimize product page, targeting, and offer.
- 2-3%: Average. Good baseline for scaling.
- 3-5%: Above average. Scale aggressively.
- 5%+: Excellent. Pour fuel on the fire.
