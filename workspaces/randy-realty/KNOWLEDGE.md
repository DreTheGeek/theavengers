## TAX DEED AUCTION PROCESS

### How Tax Deed Sales Work:
1. Property owner fails to pay property taxes for 1-5 years (varies by state)
2. County files a tax deed application with the court
3. Court grants the deed and schedules an auction
4. Property is sold at public auction to highest bidder
5. Buyer receives a tax deed — typically free and clear of most liens
6. Previous owner's equity is wiped out (unlike tax lien sales)

### Key Differences: Tax Deed vs Tax Lien
| | Tax Deed | Tax Lien |
|--|----------|----------|
| **What you buy** | The property itself | A lien (right to collect debt) |
| **Upside** | Full equity spread | Interest rate (8-36%) |
| **Risk** | Property condition, title issues | Redemption, worthless property |
| **Capital needed** | $5K-$100K+ | $500-$10K+ |
| **Best states** | FL, GA, TX, CA, CO | AZ, FL, IL, NJ, NY |

### State-Specific Rules (Focus States):

**Florida**:
- Redemption period: NONE (deed is final at auction)
- Surplus: If sale > owed taxes, previous owner may claim excess
- Online via county sites or Realauction.com
- Opening bid = total taxes owed + fees
- Research: fl.realforeclose.com

**Georgia**:
- Redemption period: 12 months (buyer must wait)
- During redemption: can't alter property
- Redemption penalty: 20% premium to buyer (guaranteed return if redeemed)
- Auctions at county courthouse, first Tuesday of month

**Texas**:
- Redemption period: 6 months (residential), 2 years (agricultural/commercial)
- Redemption penalty: 25% (first year), 50% (second year)
- Penalty rates make TX attractive even if redeemed
- Auctions at county courthouse, first Tuesday of month

## DUE DILIGENCE CHECKLIST

### Before Bidding on ANY Property:
1. **Title Search**: Check for federal tax liens (survive tax deed), HOA liens, municipal liens
2. **Property Inspection**: Drive-by or Google Street View at minimum. Interior if possible.
3. **Zoning Verification**: Confirm property is zoned for intended use
4. **Environmental Check**: Flood zone (FEMA maps), wetlands, contamination history
5. **Code Violations**: Check county code enforcement for open violations
6. **HOA Status**: If in HOA, check for unpaid dues (may survive tax deed in some states)
7. **Occupancy**: Is anyone living there? Eviction may be required.
8. **Access**: Confirm legal road access (landlocked properties are risky)
9. **Utilities**: Confirm water, sewer, electric available and connected
10. **Insurance**: Get insurance quote before bidding — some properties are uninsurable

### Red Flags (WALK AWAY):
- Federal IRS liens (survive tax deed)
- Environmental contamination (EPA Superfund, gas stations, dry cleaners)
- No legal road access
- Active litigation on the property
- Flood zone with no insurance availability
- Structure condemned by county
- HOA with massive unpaid assessments

## PROPERTY VALUATION METHODS

### Comparable Sales (Comps) — Primary Method:
1. Find 3-5 sales within 0.5 mile, within last 6 months
2. Must be similar: type, size (±20% sqft), bedrooms, condition, lot size
3. Adjust for differences: ±$20-50/sqft for condition, ±$5K per bedroom
4. Throw out outliers, average the rest = Estimated Market Value
5. Be CONSERVATIVE — use lower comps, not higher

### Income Approach (Rentals):
```
Annual Rent / Cap Rate = Property Value
Example: $1,500/month × 12 = $18,000/year
$18,000 / 0.08 (8% cap rate) = $225,000 value
```
- Cap rates by market: 6-8% (hot markets), 8-10% (average), 10-12% (emerging)

### Repair Estimation:
| Item | Budget Range |
|------|-------------|
| Cosmetic refresh (paint, carpet, fixtures) | $5-15/sqft |
| Moderate rehab (kitchen, baths, flooring) | $15-30/sqft |
| Full gut renovation | $30-60/sqft |
| Roof replacement | $5,000-15,000 |
| HVAC replacement | $3,000-8,000 |
| Foundation repair | $5,000-30,000 |
| Always add 15% contingency | |

## EXIT STRATEGY ANALYSIS

### Flip:
```
Net Profit = Market Value - (Purchase + Repairs + Holding Costs + Selling Costs)
Selling costs = 6% agent + 2% closing = ~8% of sale price
Holding costs = (Insurance + Taxes + Utilities) × months held
Target: 20%+ ROI minimum
```

### BRRRR (Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat):
```
1. Buy below market (tax deed = built-in discount)
2. Rehab to rentable condition
3. Rent at market rate
4. Refinance at new appraised value (cash-out refi at 75% LTV)
5. Repeat with recovered capital
Target: Get 100% of capital back out on refinance
```

### Hold & Rent:
```
Monthly Cash Flow = Rent - (Mortgage + Insurance + Taxes + Maintenance + Vacancy)
Vacancy reserve: 8% of annual rent
Maintenance reserve: 10% of annual rent
Target: $200+/month positive cash flow per unit
```

### Wholesale:
```
Assignment fee = Contract price to you → Higher price to end buyer
No repairs, no holding. Quick flip of the contract.
Target: $5,000-15,000 assignment fee
```

## AUCTION PLATFORMS
- **Bid4Assets**: Largest online tax deed platform. Multi-state.
- **RealAuction**: Florida counties primarily.
- **GovEase**: Growing platform, multiple states.
- **Civicsource**: Louisiana and other states.
- **County websites**: Many counties run their own auctions directly.

## KEY METRICS TO TRACK
- **Equity Spread**: Market Value - Purchase Price (before repairs)
- **ARV** (After Repair Value): What it's worth fixed up
- **Cash-on-Cash Return**: Annual cash flow / total cash invested
- **Cap Rate**: NOI / Purchase Price
- **ROI**: Total profit / Total invested
- **Days to Auction**: Registration deadlines are HARD deadlines
