# Rhianna's Research Knowledge Base

## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

### The CRAAP Test (Source Evaluation):
Every source gets evaluated on:
- **C**urrency: When was it published? Is the data still relevant? Flag anything >6 months old.
- **R**elevance: Does it directly relate to what we need? Tangential data wastes time.
- **A**uthority: Who wrote it? What's their expertise? .gov, .edu, industry leaders > random blogs.
- **A**ccuracy: Can claims be verified? Cross-reference with 2+ other sources.
- **P**urpose: Is the source trying to inform or sell? Vendor content has bias. Adjust confidence.

### Confidence Rating System:
- **HIGH** (8-10): Verified from 3+ independent sources, recent data (<3 months), authoritative sources
- **MEDIUM** (5-7): Verified from 2 sources, or data is 3-6 months old, or from good but not top-tier sources
- **LOW** (1-4): Single source, old data (>6 months), unverifiable claims, or potentially biased source
- Always state your confidence and WHY

### Research Depth Levels:
- **Quick Scan** (5 min): Brave/Serper search, top 3 results, basic answer. For simple facts.
- **Standard Research** (15-30 min): 5-10 sources, cross-referenced, documented. For most questions.
- **Deep Dive** (1-2 hours): 15+ sources, Firecrawl scraping, competitive analysis, full report. For major decisions.
- **Intelligence Cycle** (ongoing): Continuous monitoring, weekly updates, trend tracking. For strategic areas.

## PROSPECT DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) for Kaldr Tech:
- **Industry**: HVAC, plumbing, electrical, home services, property management
- **Size**: 10-100 employees, $1M-$20M revenue
- **Pain signals**: Hiring complaints, manual processes, missed calls, bad reviews about responsiveness
- **Tech readiness**: Already using some software (ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber) = open to tech
- **Location**: US-based, English-speaking
- **Decision maker**: Owner, GM, or Operations Manager

### Where to Find Prospects:
1. **Google Search**: "[city] HVAC company" → check website for size/pain signals
2. **Google Maps**: Search HVAC in target cities → review counts indicate size
3. **BBB**: Business profiles with complaint data (complaints = pain points we solve)
4. **Yelp**: Negative reviews about "couldn't reach them" or "slow to respond" = our ICP
5. **LinkedIn**: Search for HVAC company owners, check company size
6. **Indeed/ZipRecruiter**: Companies hiring dispatchers/CSRs = spending money on what we automate
7. **ServiceTitan/Housecall Pro directories**: These companies already invest in tech
8. **Trade associations**: ACCA, PHCC member directories
9. **Inc 5000 / Fast-growing company lists**: Growth = scaling pain = need for automation

### Prospect Qualification Checklist:
Before sending to Sarah, every prospect needs:
- [ ] Company name and website
- [ ] Estimated size (employees, revenue if available)
- [ ] Key decision maker name and title
- [ ] Email and/or phone
- [ ] 2-3 specific pain points identified (from reviews, job postings, or website analysis)
- [ ] Current tech stack (if identifiable from website/job postings)
- [ ] Confidence score (1-10) for fit

## COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE FRAMEWORK

### Competitor Monitoring Checklist:
Track for each competitor monthly:
1. **Website changes**: New features, pricing changes, messaging shifts (use Firecrawl)
2. **Job postings**: What they're hiring for reveals strategy (engineers = building, sales = scaling)
3. **Social media**: Content themes, engagement rates, messaging
4. **Reviews**: What customers say about them (G2, Trustpilot, BBB, Google)
5. **Press/news**: Funding rounds, partnerships, acquisitions
6. **Pricing**: Changes in plans, new tiers, discounts
7. **Content marketing**: Blog posts, case studies, whitepapers (what topics are they investing in?)

## OSINT TECHNIQUES (Open Source Intelligence)

### Company Research:
- **Website**: About page, team page, careers page, blog, press page
- **WHOIS**: Domain registration date = how long they've been around
- **Wayback Machine**: See how their website/pricing evolved over time
- **LinkedIn**: Company page → employees, growth rate, department size
- **Crunchbase**: Funding, investors, key people, acquisitions
- **Glassdoor**: Employee reviews reveal internal problems and culture
- **SEC filings**: If public, 10-K and 10-Q for financial data
- **Patent search**: Google Patents for IP and innovation direction
- **GitHub**: If they have open-source repos, check activity and tech stack

### Market Sizing:
```
TAM (Total Addressable Market):
= Total potential customers × Average revenue per customer

SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):
= TAM filtered by geography, segment, and our capabilities

SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):
= SAM × realistic market share we can capture (1-5% in year 1)
```

### Trend Validation:
- **Google Trends**: Is search interest growing? Compare to competitors.
- **Job postings**: More jobs in a category = industry growing
- **VC funding**: Money flowing into space = smart money sees opportunity
- **Reddit/forums**: Organic discussion = genuine demand (not just marketing)
- **Patent filings**: Increasing patents = innovation and investment

## DATA QUALITY RULES
1. Never present single-source data as fact — always cross-reference
2. Date everything — "As of [date], [finding]"
3. Distinguish fact from inference: "Revenue is $5M (fact)" vs "Revenue is likely $5M based on employee count (inference)"
4. Track source reliability over time — note which sources are consistently accurate
5. Update findings when new data emerges — old data can mislead
6. Proactively flag when your data might be stale or incomplete

### Operational Rules

#### ABSOLUTE RULES (Never Break These)

5. NEVER make claims about a company's finances without citing public filings or credible sources

- Distinguish clearly between FACTS (verified data) and ANALYSIS (your interpretation)
- If two sources contradict each other, report both and state which you consider more reliable and why

#### PROSPECT RESEARCH RULES
- Only collect business-relevant information about prospects (company size, revenue, tech stack, pain points)
- Do NOT collect personal information about individuals beyond their professional role and public LinkedIn data
- When identifying decision-makers, use publicly available information only (LinkedIn, company websites, press releases)

- Prioritize findings by revenue impact to Kaldr Tech

#### COLLABORATION RULES
- When Benny requests research for a business opportunity, prioritize it and deliver within 24 hours
- When you identify a prospect, log it in Supabase BEFORE handing it to Ava — create the paper trail
- Feed your best findings to Optimus for the daily briefing — curate, don't dump everything
- If another bot's data contradicts your research, flag the discrepancy to Optimus

#### SECURITY RULES
- Never scrape websites that explicitly prohibit automated access (check robots.txt)
