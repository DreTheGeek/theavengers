## HVAC & HOME SERVICE INDUSTRY DATA

### Market Overview:
- US HVAC market: ~$25 billion (2025), growing 5-6% annually
- 100,000+ HVAC companies in the US, 85% have fewer than 20 employees
- Average HVAC company revenue: $1-5M (small), $5-20M (mid), $20M+ (large)
- Peak seasons: Summer (cooling) and Winter (heating) — spring/fall are slow
- Average service call: $150-500, average install: $3,000-15,000

### Common HVAC Company Pain Points (What We Solve):
1. **Missed calls** — 62% of HVAC calls go unanswered after hours. Each missed call = $200-500 lost revenue.
2. **Manual scheduling** — Dispatchers spend 2-4 hours daily on scheduling. Wasted labor.
3. **No-shows** — 15-20% appointment no-show rate without automated reminders.
4. **Follow-up failure** — 80% of leads need 5+ touches. Most HVAC companies stop at 1-2.
5. **Review management** — 90% of customers check reviews. Most HVAC companies don't ask for reviews.
6. **Seasonal cash flow** — Revenue drops 40-60% in shoulder seasons. Need marketing automation.
7. **Technician utilization** — Average tech utilization is 65%. Optimization could hit 80-85%.
8. **Paper processes** — Many still use paper invoices, manual estimates, clipboard checklists.

### ROI Calculator (Use in Every Proposal):
```
MISSED CALLS:
X missed calls/week x $350 avg job value x 30% close rate x 52 weeks = $YYYY saved/year

SCHEDULING:
X hours/week manual scheduling x $25/hour x 52 weeks = $YYYY saved/year

NO-SHOWS:
X appointments/week x 18% no-show rate x $150 avg service call x 52 weeks = $YYYY saved/year

FOLLOW-UP:
X unconverted leads/month x 15% conversion with automation x $350 avg job = $YYYY/year
```

## SALES METHODOLOGY — CONSULTATIVE SELLING

### Discovery Call Framework (SPIN):
1. **Situation**: "How many calls does your team handle per day?" "What software do you use for scheduling?"
2. **Problem**: "What happens when calls come in after hours?" "How do you handle no-shows?"
3. **Implication**: "If you're missing 10 calls a week at $350 each, that's $182,000/year in lost revenue."
4. **Need-Payoff**: "If we could capture those after-hours calls automatically, what would that mean for your business?"

### Objection Handling Playbook:

**"It's too expensive"**
> "I understand budget is important. Let me show you the math — you're currently losing $X/year in missed calls alone. Our solution costs $Y/year. That's a Z:1 return. Can I walk you through the numbers?"

**"We already have software"**
> "That's great — you're ahead of most HVAC companies. Which platform? [Listen]. The difference with our AI solution is [specific capability they don't have]. Would it be worth a 15-minute demo to see?"

**"We're too busy right now"**
> "That's actually the perfect reason to automate. Busy season means more missed calls and scheduling headaches. If we set this up now, you capture every dollar during your peak months. Can we schedule 30 minutes next week?"

**"I need to think about it"**
> "Absolutely, this is a big decision. What specific questions are still on your mind? I want to make sure you have everything you need."

**"My guy handles everything"**
> "Having a reliable person is huge. This isn't about replacing them — it's about giving them superpowers. Automated scheduling frees them up for higher-value work. Would your dispatcher like to see a demo?"
