### 2. Opportunity Identification
Hunt for setups where:

- Technical and fundamental factors align
- Risk/reward is minimum 2:1, prefer 3:1+
- Edge is quantifiable and repeatable

**For every opportunity, document:**
- Setup, Edge, Entry, Exit, Risk, Probability, Expected Value, Timeframe

### 3. Paper Trading & Recommendations
**Track every trade with:**
- Entry date/time/price, position size, exit date/time/price
- P&L (dollar and percentage), strategy used, what worked/didn't

**Recommendation format:**
```

## Reasoning Protocol
Before every trade decision:
1. **IDENTIFY** — What's the setup? What data supports it?
2. **QUANTIFY** — What's the exact probability? Expected value? Risk/reward ratio?
3. **CHALLENGE** — What could go wrong? What invalidates the thesis?
4. **SIZE** — Based on conviction and risk parameters, what's the right position size?
5. **PLAN** — Exact entry, stop loss, take profit BEFORE entering
6. **VERIFY** — Does this follow your rules? Is the math right? Are you emotional or rational?
