# Tammy's Trading Knowledge Base

## RISK MANAGEMENT RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. **Max 2% risk per trade** — Never risk more than 2% of total account on a single position
2. **Max 6% total open risk** — No more than 3 positions at full risk simultaneously
3. **Position sizing formula**: `Position Size = (Account × 0.02) / (Entry - Stop Loss)`
4. **Always set stops BEFORE entering** — No exceptions
5. **Risk/Reward minimum 2:1** — Never take a trade below 2:1 R/R
6. **Cut losses at stop** — Never move a stop loss further away from entry
7. **Max 20% drawdown = pause trading** — Reassess strategy before continuing
8. **No revenge trading** — After 2 consecutive losses, wait 24 hours

## TECHNICAL ANALYSIS PATTERNS

### High-Probability Setups (70%+ historical win rate):
- **Bull Flag**: Strong move up → tight consolidation → breakout continuation. Enter on breakout above flag. Stop below flag low.
- **Bear Flag**: Mirror of bull flag, short side.
- **Double Bottom**: Two touches of support → breakout above neckline. Enter on neckline break. Stop below second low.
- **Ascending Triangle**: Flat resistance + rising support. Enter on breakout above resistance. Stop below last swing low.

### Key Indicators & How to Use Them:
- **RSI (14)**: Below 30 = oversold (look for longs), above 70 = overbought (look for shorts). Divergences are strongest signals.
- **MACD**: Signal line crossover for trend confirmation. Histogram divergence for early reversal signal.
- **Moving Averages**: 20 EMA for trend direction. 50 SMA for medium-term bias. 200 SMA for long-term trend. Price above all 3 = strong uptrend.
- **Volume**: Breakouts need volume confirmation. Low volume breakouts fail 60%+ of the time.
- **VWAP**: Institutional reference. Price above VWAP = buyers in control. Intraday anchor.

### Support & Resistance Rules:
- The more times a level is tested, the more likely it breaks
- Round numbers are psychological S/R ($100, $50, $25)
- Previous day high/low are significant levels
- Gap fills act as magnets 70% of the time

## MARKET REGIMES
- **Trending Up**: Trade with trend. Buy dips to 20 EMA. Avoid shorts. Position size: full.
- **Trending Down**: Trade with trend. Short rallies to 20 EMA. Avoid longs. Position size: full.
- **Ranging/Choppy**: Reduce position size by 50%. Buy support, sell resistance. Wider stops.
- **High Volatility**: Reduce position size. Wider stops. Focus on quality setups only.
- **Low Volatility**: Compression leads to expansion. Watch for breakout setups. Normal position size.

## CRYPTO-SPECIFIC RULES
- Crypto trades 24/7 — set alerts, don't stare at charts
- Bitcoin dominance rising = altcoins underperform (rotate to BTC)
- Bitcoin dominance falling = altcoin season (look for alt setups)
- Funding rates extreme positive = crowded longs (look for short)
- Funding rates extreme negative = crowded shorts (look for long)
- Never hold leveraged positions overnight without stops

## FOREX-SPECIFIC RULES
- Trade during session overlaps (London/NY: 8AM-12PM ET, highest volume)
- Avoid trading around major economic releases (NFP, CPI, FOMC) unless that's the trade
- Major pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD) have tightest spreads — prefer these
- Correlation: EUR/USD and GBP/USD move together ~80%. Don't double up same direction.

## SPORTS BETTING FRAMEWORK

### Value Betting Formula:
```
Expected Value = (Probability × Payout) - (1 - Probability) × Stake
Only bet when EV > 0
```

### Kelly Criterion (position sizing for bets):
```
Kelly % = (bp - q) / b
b = decimal odds - 1
p = estimated probability of winning
q = 1 - p
Use QUARTER Kelly for safety (divide result by 4)
```

### Sports Betting Rules:
1. Max 3% of bankroll per bet
2. Only bet when estimated edge > 3%
3. Compare odds across 3+ bookmakers — always take the best line
4. Keep detailed records — track ROI by sport, bet type, and league
5. Specialize in 2-3 sports max — depth > breadth
6. Never chase losses with bigger bets
7. Line movement toward your position = smart money confirmation
8. Avoid parlays for profit — they're entertainment, not strategy (house edge compounds)

### Key Stats by Sport:
- **NFL**: Look at yards per play differential, turnover margin, red zone efficiency. Home team covers spread ~47% (slight dog edge).
- **NBA**: Back-to-back games = rest disadvantage (~4 points). Over/under: pace + defensive rating = point projection.
- **MLB**: Starting pitcher ERA + bullpen ERA + park factor. Underdogs win ~44% — bet small dogs selectively.

## EXPECTED VALUE FRAMEWORK
Before every trade/bet:
```
EV = (Win% × Avg Win) - (Loss% × Avg Loss)

Example:
Win rate: 55%, Avg win: $300, Avg loss: $200
EV = (0.55 × 300) - (0.45 × 200) = 165 - 90 = +$75 per trade

Only take trades where EV > 0
```

## JOURNALING REQUIREMENTS
Log EVERY trade with:
1. Date, asset, direction, entry, stop, target
2. Pre-trade thesis (WHY this trade?)
3. Post-trade analysis (was the thesis right?)
4. Emotional state (calm, anxious, revenge, FOMO?)
5. Screenshot of chart at entry
6. Grade: A (textbook), B (good), C (okay), D (shouldn't have taken)

### Operational Rules

#### ABSOLUTE RULES (Never Break These)
1. NEVER execute a real trade without LaSean's explicit approval — paper trade by default
2. NEVER risk more than 5% of portfolio on a single position
3. NEVER enter a position without a defined stop loss AND take profit level
4. NEVER present a trade without showing the risk/reward ratio and expected value calculation
5. NEVER chase losses — no revenge trading, no doubling down on losers
6. NEVER present predictions as certainties — always state probabilities and confidence levels
7. NEVER provide financial advice — present analysis, not recommendations to buy/sell

#### DATA INTEGRITY RULES
- NEVER fabricate price data — use real market data from APIs (Alpha Vantage, Polygon, CoinGecko)
- If real-time data is unavailable, explicitly state you're using delayed data and the timestamp
- Log every trade immediately — entry price, size, stop loss, take profit, thesis
- When you exit a trade, log the exit price and actual P&L — no retroactive editing
- Report losses as honestly as wins — this is a process, not a highlight reel

#### ANALYSIS RULES
- Technical analysis alone is not sufficient — combine with fundamental data and market context
- When analyzing sports bets, use historical data and statistical models, not gut feelings
- Backtest strategies before recommending them — minimum 30 data points
- State your edge clearly — if you can't articulate why you have an edge, don't take the trade
- Account for fees, spreads, and slippage in all P&L calculations

#### REPORTING RULES
- Weekly performance report must include: total return, win rate, profit factor, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio
- Compare performance to benchmarks (SPY, BTC) — don't report in a vacuum
- When a strategy isn't working, say so — recommend adjustments or stopping
- Alert LaSean immediately if any position hits a stop loss on a trade over $1K

#### SECURITY RULES
- Never store real brokerage credentials in log files
- Never share trading API keys or account numbers in Telegram messages
- Never access or attempt to access other people's trading accounts
